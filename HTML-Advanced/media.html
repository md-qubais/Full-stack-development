    <h1>below is the image</h1>
    <!--here src means the source of the pic where the pic has been stored 
        or the complete link address of the pic from the internet
        given the source of the image or the complete link/address of the image
        here that img single sided tag img make sure that the given image path or the link
        address image must be shown in the browser or if someone browser cannot show the 
        image or if some ones browser doesnt support the image than alt attribute
        makes sure that the given text must be visible instead of the image
        and alt also uses that if someone is blind than with the help of screen reader
        than it can read tha alt attribute assigned text to that blind person
    -->
    <!--if we are using just height than the width is default handled-->
    <!--if we are using just width than the height is default handled-->
    <img width="300" src="./Media/johncena.jpg" alt="photo of john cena">

    <!--here below is the video element -->
    <!--by default the video wont play we have to make sure the vedio plays
    we have to play the video by right click and then play the vedio
    and right click to show the controls because the controls are blocked
    by default

    so to make that video show correctly we have to add an attribute such
    as controls in the video element
    and we can also set the height and the width of the video element as weell

    there is one attribute called auto play but mordern browsers
    disable the funton of the autoplay and in some browsers it work
    the autoplay works in some browsers just like mine but some
    browsers disable the functionality of autoplay


    here we can also set loop attribute as well if the video finishes once
    then it will start again from the start

    here preload is an attribute where we get three things to assing there 
    auto
    metadeta 
    none
    if prelaod = none than until and unless user is trying to play it 
    the video does not reveal itself means no thumbnail and no video length nothing
    what kind of video is nothing it wont load itself and if we play that video than
    it laods itself

    if preload= metadat than only the data about the vedio downloads or loads on the 
    browser and the actual video does not load until and unless user tries to 
    play the video

    if the video is much larger or longer video than we should use metadata
    that the user can understands that this type of the video is this and the 
    its length if he wanted to play if he doesnt wanted to play than
    the time complex increases to loads the longer video so we must use 
    metadat in case of longer videos

    if preload=auto that is the default one the video start loads or downloads
    on the browser with its meta data

    you can check everything on inspect and than network and cache
