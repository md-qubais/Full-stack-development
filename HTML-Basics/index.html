<!--we can have multiple html tags inside the document 
browser specifice which type of language that browser can understand
if it can understand the english language the browser reneder html element
with the attribute consits of language english
or if the browser understands that hindi language than the browser
will render the html element with the attribute language which is hind
so here we can have multiple html tags depened upon the browser which to execute
if the lanngauge is not found by the browser than the browser
will render the default language or the browser will render the html element
which has no language tag

<!--if the javscript dont work on your browser or the css wont work on
your browser than the html element must be able to take care about the sections 
and all the stuff and should look some what good not weird
the user must understand the web page without the javscript and the css
that good we have to place the html tags and html elements and must look good
HTML is just for displaying our content and the css is just for styling
and javascript for interaction or making the website interactive
-->

<!--here below is the p tag or p element for paragraph
here in html there are some elements that have default styling and comes with default styling

-->

<!--by default paragraph have some of the margin aorund them or padding around them
while the normal text doesnt have padding or margin around them-->
<!--when we are using the p tag it takes the entire horizontal strip in that tag only
and that entire strip is available for that tag only

and this type of tags or elements are called block elements
which takes tha entire block
this block the entire horizontal space and next element will start from
tbe next line of that element

-->
<p>
    this is the first paragraph
</p>
<p>
    this is the second paragraph
</p>
this is normal text
this is anaother normal text 
and there is no new line between them
here there is no new line because in the html 
the tab, spaces and the new line all three are white spaces 
all of them are to be considered as the white space 
if we need or if we wanted to give a line break
than we have to use <br>
this tag or element <br> this one
<!--notice here the br element does not have closing tag its just single tag element-->
<br>
</br> <!--if we write the tag like this is also consider them as br thats only with
the single sided tags no opning and no closing tags and we cannot put anything inside them
because there is no opening and no closing tag in that element -->


<!--here there are some text formatting tabs that we are going to use-->
this is <i>italic text</i> <br>

<!--here above or below the element that are i and b that are know ans the inline
element that does not take the entire block just stick where are they and the 
next element or text or tags can be start beside these type of inline element

and also we can change their property from inline element to block element
or we can also change from block element to inline element with the help of some
CSS Cascading Style Sheets just write there display: block or display: inline by
selecting that tag or that element or defining some class or id attricubte to that element or tag
-->

this is <b>bold text</b> <br>
