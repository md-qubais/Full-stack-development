    <!--here below in the style element we can write the css
    cascading style sheets which is used to style the html elements
    or the styling the structure which is mainly used for styling

    below we can directly select the element or tag
    like this and we can style whatever we want

    and we can also link the stylesheet that is css
    and we can write entire css in different folder 
    and instead of writing the entire css in the head section of html element
    we can write the css in different file by linking that file to this html 
    like below way
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

    <style>
        div{
            background-color: aliceblue;
            font-size: 20pt;
        }
        p{
            background-color: azure;
            font-size: large;
        }

    </h1>
    <!--here below we can also style the element konw as inline css styling
    like below 
    this inline styling gets the first preferance if we write here

    or different sheet style linking
