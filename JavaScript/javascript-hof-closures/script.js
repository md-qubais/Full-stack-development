/*
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references
 to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
 In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer 
 functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript,
  closures are created every time a function is created, 
  at function creation time.

  //and we cannot capture the arguments in the inner function

  //by assing all the arguments to some variable we can assing that in inner function

//when ever the curr_function is define whatever scopes of the variable or any scopes that

//that scopes that are present at the time of its birth place are captured
