    <!--
        here below is the iframes means we can embed another html page to 
        the current html page
        that we can acheive through iframes and we can remove border 
        by using frameborder=0 and we can give it some of the height and width

        if we remove the iframe border that the users cant understand that 
        this part of the page comes from other html file if we remove border
        if we put border than it gives some hint that this part of the page
        may be from any another page

        iframes simply means a page inside a page

        we can do many things using the iframes we can embed the youtube video 
        and we can do lots of things like the github code
        payment integration and many many things that we can do 
        with the help of iframes
    -->
    <!--here below i have embeded that youtube video inside our iframe-->
    <h1>IFrames</h1>
    <iframe
      height="400"
      width="500"
      src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOJf9dsPRbs"
      frameborder="0"

    <h1>IFrames</h1>
    <!--here below we can assing target as the name of the frame
    by using the name attribute in the iframe element instead of class or id
    we can use name element in the iframe attribute and than in the anchor tag
    or a element we can use that given links to open in the corresponding
    iframe by using the target attribute and by assignuing the name of the 
    iframe into that target attribute 


    there are lots of websites for security reasons that dont open in the iframes
    for example google in link.html will not be able to open in the iframes
    so either we have to open that google.com in another page
    or either we have to open that google.com in self page means current parent page
    so there is an attribute target in the anchor tag self means current browser page
    blank means new tab
    parent means if we are using the iframes than the google.com wont be open in iframe that is self
    than instead we have to use and assing either _blank to open in new tab or either _parent
    to open completely in parent of that iframe it in this that parent is the current page
    the parent of the link.html is the current page so the google.com will open 
    completely in the current page    
-->
    <h1>Opne in frame :</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><a target="frame1" href="./links.html">links.html file</a></li>
      <li>
        <a target="frame2" href="./inner_links.html">inner_links.html file</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <!--here go to links.html file change that to _self,_blank and _parent 
    and see what happens
    in case of parent if there is no parent the current href will open
    that web page inside the current page


    if we are going to add the same current page in the iframes than
    we are going to achieve recursion through it
-->

    <!--we can access the immediate parent using _parent and assigning that _parent
directly to the target and we can assign the top most parent or root or ancestor
using _top and assigning that _top to that target  but we cannot assign the middle one just like the binary trees concept
