    <h1><a target="_parent" href="https://google.com">go to google</a></h1>
    <!--here below we can also give our own created .html link name like ./inner_links.html
as the link in the href which currently tells us that the inner_links.html file is 
present in the current directory and just redirect there these type of links are known
as the relative links

       below are the properties that we can use in the target
       target
       Where to display the linked URL, as the name for a browsing context (a tab, window, or <iframe>). The following keywords have special meanings for where to load the URL:
           _self: the current browsing context. (Default)
           _blank: usually a new tab, but users can configure browsers to open a new window instead.
           _parent: the parent browsing context of the current one. If no parent, behaves as _self.
           _top: the topmost browsing context (the "highest" context thatâ€™s an ancestor of the current one). If no ancestors, behaves as _self.
