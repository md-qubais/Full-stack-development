    <script>
        console.log("this is printed first");
        alert("dont browse")
        //what happens in case of alert 
        //untill and unless the user doesnt click the rest of the 
        //page rendering gets stop 
        //the browser reads the html line by line and when it reaches
        //the box than its shows alert till then untill the user doesnt
        //clicks the page html rendering gets blocked
        //click ok then the page get rendered and display

        //if alert msgs in head than the body will not be rendered till the user
        //clicks on it
      </script>
    <!--if we are wrinting script and linking the file than 
    whatever javscript written inside the script will not be evaluated if src exits
    

     here below async means that the javascript file get downloaded
     parallel while rendering html
     and defer is the boolean value to show that browser must
     execute the javascript file after the html is completely rendered
     depends upon the browser 

     actually javascript is intrepreted and concept like repl=>check the google hahaha
     it exe line by line does not care about the next line until it get evaluated
     open about:blank and write javascipt there in that console inpect
    -->
    <script async defer src="./script.js">
        console.log("it wont get evaluated and it wont be printed")
        //by wrinting the async defer the html page will get rendered while
        //the javscript file get evaluated
        //that means that the javascirpt execution get parallel while rendering the 
        //html so the htmml rendereds at the background and then we get a msg
        //that alert msg that agin dont browse depends upon the browser
        //how much the page get rendered parallely while executing the javascript file
    </script>


  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>here the page loaded after user click ok on dont browse</h1>
    <p>this is the paragraph that is rendered</p>
    <!--there are many ways to write the javascript thta we can link script file in
    the head element of the html

    and we can write inside the boy using script tag
    -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
      console.log("this is javascirpt and printed third");
      //alert("dont do ")
      //the output will be the script src first because it is first rendered
      //and than it will print the this is javascirpt in the console in inspect section
      //we can actually write window.alert()
      //and we can also simply write alert()
    </script>
    <h1>here the page loaded after user click ok on again dont browse</h1>
