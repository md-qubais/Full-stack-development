        here in css it will work fine because
        acccording to the definition of id and class
        id is one to one mapping and class will have many to many mapping
        one element should have exactly one id and one id should associated to 
        exactly one element
        many elements can have same class and one class can be associated to
        many elements
        that above is the definition of the id and class
        
        spaces seperated in the class attribute will be considered as many different classes
        such as ==> class="s1 s2 s3" ==> here s1 s2 and s3

        spaces seperated in the id attribute will be considered as single id value
        such as ==> id="s1 s2 s2" ==> here s1 s2 s3 is single id not three different

        so what happens if we give same id to multiple elements
        if we assign single id on multiple elements
        css wont be that harsh it that css will be work on multiple elements 
        as well but in the javascipt there is one method like
        document.getElementbyId() then it will give some weird like thing
        we dont know that which element of that particular id will that 
        javascript method will be considered

    <h2 id="id1">imaduddin</h2>
