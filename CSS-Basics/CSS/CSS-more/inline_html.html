    <!--here we are going to know about inline elements and blocks element
    all the blocks elements such as h1,h2,h3.....and p and div 
    these all are block element these basically take the entire horizontal
    strip
    means entire left to right into them selves and any inline elements
    means all the inline elements will be below the block elements
    and all the block elements always start with the new line
    we can change their functionalities using css
    we can change from inline to block and from block to inline in css

    if the element is block we can just set up margin from left and right
    top and bottom we can also give padding if the element is block
    that wont be happen and possible in inline elements we can convert
    it into block and can do whatever we want
    -->
    <h1 style="display: inline;">this is header and this is also block element</h1>
    <p style="display: inline;">this is block paragraph this will take the entire horizontal line</p> this will appear in next line because this is inline element
    <b style="display: block;">this is bold and this is also inline element</b>

    <!--here the fiv and span
    the div is block element and span in inline element
    but unlinke another block elements the div doesnt have any special
    styling such as h1 make the text bold and p makes the entire top and bottom margin
    and span also is like any another inline element
    but the thing is the div is block element do which are very useful
    for the grouping of the another html standards and can be used for styling

    the most simple block element is div 
    and the most simple inline elemnet is span 
    we can use both of them for styling
    -->
